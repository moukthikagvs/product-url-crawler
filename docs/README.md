 Overview:

 This web crawler automates the process of finding product URLs across multiple e-commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart, Ajio, and more. Itâ€™s built to handle JavaScript-heavy pages using Selenium and ensures that only real product links are captured while skipping ads and other irrelevant pages.

Features:

Extracts only actual product URLs, filtering out banners, ads, and unnecessary links.
Handles dynamic websites using Selenium for JavaScript-loaded content.
Rotates User-Agents to help avoid getting blocked.
Saves results in both JSON and CSV formats for easy access and analysis.
